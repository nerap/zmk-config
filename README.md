Allister's ZMK Config
=====================

The `amacleod/zmk-config` repo contains Allister MacLeod's ZMK
keymaps, config files, and build files for wireless keyboard firmware
built with ZMK (https://zmk.dev/). These layouts are largely informed
by personal preference, but derive influence from a number of sources.

Inspirations
------------

The following designs and writings have served as inspiration:
- Pascal Getreuer's posts about keyboards (https://getreuer.info/posts/keyboards/index.html)
- Callum Oakley's QMK keymap, particularly one-shot mods (https://github.com/callum-oakley/qmk_firmware/tree/master/users/callum)
- the Miryoku layout (https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku)
- Alan Reiser's Hands Down layouts, especially Hands Down Neu (https://sites.google.com/alanreiser.com/handsdown)

Personal Notes
--------------

Reminder to self, regarding Bluetooth profiles on boards with five
such profiles; here's which devices to link to each profile:

1. Desktop PC
2. iPad
3. Work MacBook
4. Linux Laptop
5. ???
